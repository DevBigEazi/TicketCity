Blacklist Tracking: A new mapping called blacklistedOrganizers tracks which organizers have been blacklisted.
Threshold Configuration: I've added a constant MAX_ALLOWED_SCAM_EVENTS (set to 1 by default) that defines how many scam events an organizer can have before being blacklisted.
Blacklist Check: The createEvent function now verifies that the organizer is not blacklisted before allowing them to create a new event.
Automatic Blacklisting: When an event is flagged as a scam and refunds are processed, the organizer is automatically blacklisted if they reach or exceed the threshold.
Admin Control: I've added a function for the contract owner to manually blacklist or unblacklist organizers if needed (for dispute resolution or special cases).
Events: New events are emitted when an organizer is blacklisted or unblacklisted to maintain transparency.


Looking at the contract code, the STAKE_PERCENTAGE (20) is indeed separate from the DAMAGE_FEE (0.05 ether), but they serve related purposes in the contract's anti-scam protection system:

STAKE_PERCENTAGE (20) - This defines the percentage (20%) of expected revenue that event organizers must stake when creating paid events. This is calculated in the calculateRequiredStake function.
DAMAGE_FEE (0.05 ether) - This is a fixed amount used as the minimum stake for free events and potentially as part of the penalty for malicious behavior.

The contract has a sophisticated staking and reputation system:

For paid events, organizers must stake a percentage of expected revenue (STAKE_PERCENTAGE = 20%)
For free events, organizers must stake at least the DAMAGE_FEE (0.05 ether)
New organizers face an additional penalty (NEW_ORGANIZER_PENALTY = 10%)
Organizers with good reputation get discounts (REPUTATION_DISCOUNT_FACTOR = 5% per successful event)
Organizers with history of scammed events face increased stake requirements (15% per scam)

When an event is flagged as scam by enough attendees, the staked amount is used to process refunds. The contract does not explicitly label the staked amount as a "damage fee" when used for refunds, but functionally that's what it becomes - compensation for affected attendees.
The damage fee specifically appears to be refundable if an event is successful, as seen in this code from the releaseRevenue function:
In summary, while STAKE_PERCENTAGE and DAMAGE_FEE are different constants, they are both part of the contract's protection mechanism against malicious organizers. The stake amount (calculated using STAKE_PERCENTAGE for paid events) effectively serves as a damage fee if the organizer acts maliciously, as it can be used to process refunds for attendees.
